# levelup
This is the site for helping new RoboCats to get started in the team.
Four levels; from high overview, to basic robotics.

## Goals
Have fun.
Let new RoboCat team members understand what we do, so they can begin contributing.
Build the team spirit.
By the end of the Levels, new RoboCats should be able to connect the controller, and drive the robot.
A side benefit is that potential RoboCats will understand what we do, and enquire further.

## Intended Audience
New RoboCat girls aged 13 to 18.
No pre-existing knowledge of robotics, and little knowledge of the team.

## Platform
Web hosted for first level. Subsequent levels are visible on the Web, but executed 
in person with a mentor and robot hardware.
