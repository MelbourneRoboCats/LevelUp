# levelup
This is the site for helping new RoboCats to get started in the team.<br/>
Four levels; from high overview, to basic robotics.

## Goals
Have fun.<br/>
Let new RoboCat team members understand what we do, so they can begin contributing.<br/>
Build the team spirit.<br/>
By the end of the Levels, new RoboCats should be able to connect the controller, and drive the robot.<br/>
A side benefit is that potential RoboCats will understand what we do, and enquire further.

## Intended Audience
New RoboCat girls aged 13 to 18.<br/>
No pre-existing knowledge of robotics, and little knowledge of the team.<br/>

## Platform
Web hosted for first level. Subsequent levels are visible on the Web, but executed<br/>
in person with a mentor and robot hardware.<br/>
